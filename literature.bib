  abstract = {In many commercial systems, the 'best bet' recommendations are shown, but the predicted rating values are not. This is usually referred to as a top-N recommendation task, where the goal of the recommender system is to find a few specific items which are supposed to be most appealing to the user. Common methodologies based on error metrics (such as RMSE) are not a natural fit for evaluating the top-N recommendation task. Rather, top-N performance can be directly measured by alternative methodologies based on accuracy metrics (such as precision/recall).An extensive evaluation of several state-of-the art recommender algorithms suggests that algorithms optimized for minimizing RMSE do not necessarily perform as expected in terms of top-N recommendation task. Results show that improvements in RMSE often do not translate into accuracy improvements. In particular, a naive non-personalized algorithm can outperform some common recommendation approaches and almost match the accuracy of sophisticated algorithms. Another finding is that the very few top popular items can skew the top-N performance. The analysis points out that when evaluating a recommender algorithm on the top-N recommendation task, the test set should be chosen carefully in order to not bias accuracy metrics towards non-personalized solutions. Finally, we offer practitioners new variants of two collaborative filtering algorithms that, regardless of their RMSE, significantly outperform other recommender algorithms in pursuing the top-N recommendation task, with offering additional practical advantages. This comes at surprise given the simplicity of these two methods.},

  abstract = {We introduce EigenRec; a versatile and efficient Latent-Factor framework for Top-N Recommendations that includes the well-known PureSVD algorithm as a special case. EigenRec builds a low dimensional model of an inter-item proximity matrix that combines a similarity component, with a scaling operator, designed to control the influence of the prior item popularity on the final model. Seeing PureSVD within our framework provides intuition about its inner workings, exposes its inherent limitations, and also, paves the path towards painlessly improving its recommendation performance. A comprehensive set of experiments on the MovieLens and the Yahoo datasets based on widely applied performance metrics, indicate that EigenRec outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms, in terms of Standard and Long-Tail recommendation accuracy, exhibiting low susceptibility to sparsity, even in its most extreme manifestations -- the Cold-Start problems. At the same time EigenRec has an attractive computational profile and it can apply readily in large-scale recommendation settings.},
